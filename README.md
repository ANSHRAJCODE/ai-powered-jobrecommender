ü§ñ AI-Powered Job Recommendation SystemAn exceptional, full-stack web application designed to provide personalized, AI-driven job recommendations. This project goes beyond simple matching by incorporating advanced features like Explainable AI (XAI), resume parsing, and user-specific data persistence to deliver a truly valuable and intelligent career tool.<!--Live Demo: [Link to your deployed app will go here]--><!--A GIF or screenshot of your application in action is highly recommended here.You can use a tool like ScreenToGif to record your screen.-->‚ú® FeaturesThis project is a complete, multi-page web application that demonstrates a wide range of skills, from backend system design and cloud database management to advanced AI model integration and a polished user interface.User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login system using JWT tokens and Argon2 password hashing, with user data stored in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database.Resume Parsing & Embedding: Users can upload their resume (PDF), which is then parsed on the backend. The extracted text is converted into a numerical vector embedding using Sentence Transformers and saved to the user's profile.Semantic Recommendation Engine: The core of the application uses a Sentence Transformer (SBERT) model to calculate the semantic similarity between a user's resume embedding and a pre-processed database of job embeddings.Explainable AI (XAI): For each job recommendation, a secondary LLM (Google's Gemini) generates a concise, human-readable explanation detailing why the job is a good match, highlighting specific skill overlaps.Persistent User Profiles: All user data, including parsed resume text and embeddings, is saved securely in a Supabase cloud database, allowing users to log in from anywhere and get instant recommendations.Saved Jobs & Analytics: Users can "save" jobs they are interested in. A dedicated analytics page then visualizes their saved job data, showing metrics like average match score and a breakdown of jobs by company.Professional Multi-Page UI: A clean, modern, multi-page user interface built with Streamlit, featuring a custom theme and a logical user flow with separate pages for login, profile management, recommendations, saved jobs, and analytics.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackend: FastAPI, Python, UvicornFrontend: StreamlitAI/ML:Recommendation: Sentence Transformers (SBERT) for embeddings, Scikit-learn for similarity calculation.Explainability (XAI): Google Gemini via API, LangChain.Data Prep: Pandas, NumPy, Joblib, NLTK.Database: Supabase (Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL), SQLAlchemyAuthentication: JWT Tokens, Argon2Resume Parsing: pdfplumberüöÄ Running Locally1. Project SetupClone the repository and set up the project structure. The backend and frontend are in separate directories.git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-job-recommender
2. Create and Activate Conda Environmentconda create --name job_recommender_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate job_recommender_env
3. Install DependenciesInstall all necessary libraries for both the backend and frontend.pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install streamlit plotly # Install frontend-specific libraries
4. Set Up Environment VariablesCreate a .env file inside the backend folder and add your secret keys:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_for_jwt"
DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_postgresql_connection_string"
5. Run the ApplicationYou will need two separate terminals to run the full application.Terminal 1: Start the Backend Servercd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload
Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Appstreamlit run frontend/Home.py
The application will be available at http://localhost:8501.
